1. Given a string of 6 digits. Check that the sum of the first three digits is equal to the sum of the second three digits. If so, print 'yes', otherwise print 'no'.
2. Number n=1000 is given. Divide it by 2 so many times until the result of the division is less than 50. What number will you get? Count the number of iterations needed to do this (an iteration is a loop through) and store it in the num variable.
3. An array arr is given. Find the arithmetic mean of its elements. Check the problem on an array with elements 12, 15, 20, 25, 59, 79.
4. An array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is given. Make it an array [1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c', 4, 5].
5. An array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is given. Make it an array [1, 'a', 'b', 2, 3, 4, 'c', 5, 'e'].
6. An array [3, 4, 1, 2, 7] is given. Sort it.
